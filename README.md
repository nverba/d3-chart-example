### D3 chart example

This is a D3 chart I constructed as part of a now defunct project, to scrape some simple Twitter statistics daily and apply them to monthly charts that could be exported as images for inclusion in some social media reports.
The backend became unsustainable after Twitter changed the API and associated rate limits, I've since extracted the main chart from the application and posted it here as an example of previous work.

You can see the live example over on the [Demo](http://nverba.github.io/d3-chart-example/) page, it is set up with a single month of dummy data.
